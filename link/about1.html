				<h2 id="community">Our Core Values</h2>
				<p><b>Personal responsibility and nonviolence.</b> We take action based on conscience. This means we are accountable for our actions and take personal responsibility. We are committed to peacefulness</p>
				<p><b>Independence.</b> We do not accept money from governments, corporations or political parties.<br>
				Individual contributions, together with grants from foundations, are the only source of our funding.</p>
				<p><b>Promoting Solutions.</b> I'ts not enough for us to point the finger; we develop, research and promote concrete steps towards a green and peaceful future for all of us.</p>
				<h2>Fundraising Principles</h2>
				<p>At Planet Green we are honoured that our work is funded almost entirely by donations given to us by passionate individuals from all over the world who care about the planet and want to help us create change, and by grants from private foundations who share our values.</p>
				<p>Our indeoendence is vital for us to be effective in our campaign work, which is why we have it as a core principle that guides all of our fundraising.</p>
				<p>We also screen all large private donations to identify if there is anything about them which could compromise our independence, our integrity or deflect from our campaign priorities.<br>
				If we find something then we will refuse or return the donation</p>
				<h2>Transparency and Accountability</h2>
				<p>Planet Green works actively to ensure trasparency and public accountability in it's campaigning, fundraising and financial management practices.</p>
				<h2>Integrity System</h2>








				<p>As Planet Green, our success depends on building a movement of people with the courage and conviction to help build a better world. The strength this movement as well as the integrity and reputation of Planet Green depends on th ability of its people to uphold and promote the highest standards of ethical and professional conduct.</p>
				<p>the responsibility for upholding this integrity is shared and upheld by each staff member, in each NPO, and every country that we operate in as they work with communities to promote a green and peaceful future for us all.</p>
